# Abaqus-VDFLUX-DFLUX-Subroutines-in-Fortran-Language-for-Welding-Simulation
In the project, we modeled welding in Abaqus using DFLUX subroutine. DFLUX subroutine is an Abaqus tool, designed for thermal loading in form of body/surface fluxes, as a function of time, coordinates, etc. DFLUX subroutine is available for the Abaqus Standard solver, while its equivalent for the Explicit solver is called VDFLUX.We also have a free blog on our website that delves into the details of DFLUX/VDFLUX subroutines. You can access it through the provided link.
